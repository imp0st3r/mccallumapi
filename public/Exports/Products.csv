Starting with the heavy duty black anodized aluminum heatsink with the Addictive Audio logo laser etched on the face (not another peel and stick logo). The heatsink is engineered with multiple vertical and horizontal fins to provide maximum heat dissipation to avoid having to introduce noisy cooling fans into the circuitry. Internally the FETs are vertically clamped against the sides of the heatsink to move heat to the side fins. Also, by vertically mounting the FETs this reduces the heatsink footprint by 2 inches in width. All Elite amplifiers have dual power supplies, only gold banded resistors are used throughout, dual handwound power supply transformers, aluminum shaft potentiometers, and all components are soldered into the best available printed circuit board.",249.99,false,false,false,false,false,false,0,,,,199.99

We like to think outside the box and needed a woofer that not only could be mounted in less than 4 in. mounting depth, but a woofer that could really play the low frequencies that often are missing from the pancake design.",165.99,false,false,false,false,false,false,0,,,,99.99
